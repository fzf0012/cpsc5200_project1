    <h2>How to Make Lemon Meringue Pie</h2>

    <p>
    You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below â€” but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make
    this old-fashioned lemon meringue pie:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Make the filling: Combine the dry ingredients in a saucepan, then add the water and lemon juice and zest. Bring
            to a boil, then stir in the butter. Place the egg yolks in a bowl and stir in half the sugar mixture. Whisk this
            mixture back into the original mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make the meringue: Beat the egg whites until foamy. Add the sugar and continue beating until stiff peaks form.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake the pie: Pour the filling into the pie shell and top with meringue. Bake in the preheated oven until the
            meringue is golden brown.
        </li>

    </ol>


    <h2>Does Lemon Meringue Pie Need to Be Refrigerated?</h2>

    <p>
        Yes, lemon meringue pie should be refrigerated. To prevent foodborne illness, never let it sit at room temperature
        for more than two hours.

        To store lemon meringue pie without messing up the meringue, place two toothpicks in the pie. Loosely cover it with
        storage wrap and store in the refrigerator for up to two days.
    </p>

    <h2>Can You Make Lemon Meringue Pie Ahead of Time?</h2>

    <p>
        Yes! Since lemon meringue pie is served chilled, it's a great make-ahead dessert. You can make lemon meringue pie up
        to one day in advance.
    </p>


    <h2>Can You Freeze Lemon Meringue Pie?</h2>

    <p>
        The best way to freeze lemon meringue pie is without the meringue. Pour the filling into the pie crust, wrap tightly
        in storage wrap and foil, and freeze for up to three months. Thaw in the refrigerator, then make the meringue and
        bake according to the recipe.

    <h2>Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise</h2>

    <p>
        "Wonderful recipe," raves one Allrecipes community member. "No adjustments made to the recipe. I cooled it for about
        one hour at room temperature and then placed it uncovered in the refrigerator for about 2-3 hours before serving.
        Definitely a keeper!"

        "This recipe was so easy and turned out beautifully," according to blueeyedjane.

        "I have been using this recipe for a few years, and honestly don't think there's a better one anywhere," says
        kklowell. "This pie is delicious! It's also quite easy to make. I recently made six different pies for a party, and
        this was one of the first to be gone."
